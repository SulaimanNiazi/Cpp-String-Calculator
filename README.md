# Cpp String Calculator

Cpp String Calculator is a simple calculator program written in C++ that takes an arithmetic equation as a string input and returns the result. It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- Handles floating-point numbers.
- Detects and reports syntax errors in the input equation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- A terminal or command prompt

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the source code using your C++ compiler. For example:

    ```sh
    g++ -o main main.cpp
    ```

4. Run the compiled executable:

    ```sh
    ./main
    ```

### Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Enter an arithmetic equation when prompted, without spaces.
3. The program will display the entered equation and the calculated result.

### Example

```
Enter equation: 12.5+7.3*2-5/2.5
You entered: 12.5+7.3*2-5/2.5
Solution: 25.9
